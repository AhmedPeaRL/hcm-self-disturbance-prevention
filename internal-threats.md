## Internal Disturbance Sources

Recognized internal threats include:

- Desire to relive the initial insight
- Urge to improve what is already stable
- Anxiety disguised as refinement
- Nostalgia for the moment of creation
- Pressure to "do more" after validation

These impulses must not alter the system.
